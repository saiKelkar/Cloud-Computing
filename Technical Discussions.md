1. Implement technical discussions that include reproducible code.
   (Effective repeatable technical discussions - 4 ways)
    1. GitHub + Markdown
       (new repo -- README (for Markdown) -- .gitignore (for Python))
    2. Gist
       (in GitHub Gist -- to share code (for exact syntax highlighting, exact formatting -- reproducible code sample))
    3. Colab + Jupyter
       (easy to create reproducible code)
    4. Images
       (Issues in repo -- to create ticket -- upload an image of the code snippet)
2. Create a 30 second - two minute demo video that communicates the technical details for the problem at hand.
    1. (free software to make a video (many available) -- 1080p or higher (good range) -- 30 seconds to 2.5 minutes)
3. Create high-quality technical notes that are reusable across multiple platforms.
    1. (Jonathan Heimer MIT book on Critical Thinking -- courage to fight for what you believe in via the research that you've done -- empathy -- autonomy (independently coming to our own viewpoint via readings and own research) -- integrity (playing tricks to misinform people to avoid) -- perseverance (ability to go through a document to say something is the best solution) -- confidence in reasoning -- fair-mindedness) -- critical thinking to come at the best solution given the problem at hand
    2. Effective technical triple threat (degree -- portfolio of work (GitHub projects with YouTube videos to show how the project works) -- certifications (cloud based certifications))
