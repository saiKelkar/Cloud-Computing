1. Implement technical discussions that include reproducible code.
   (Effective repeatable technical discussions - 4 ways)
    1. GitHub + Markdown
       (new repo -- README (for Markdown) -- .gitignore (for Python))
    2. Gist
       (in GitHub Gist -- to share code (for exact syntax highlighting, exact formatting -- reproducible code sample))
    3. Colab + Jupyter
       (easy to create reproducible code)
2. Create a 30 second - two minute demo video that communicates the technical details for the problem at hand.
3. Create high-quality technical notes that are reusable across multiple platforms.
